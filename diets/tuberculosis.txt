Foods to Take

1. Consume protein-rich foods
Protein is crucial for the growth, repair and maintenance of tissues in the body, and TB patients require more protein to aid recovery. Protein-rich foods like eggs, lean meat, poultry, fish, beans, lentils and nuts are excellent sources of protein. Consuming protein-rich foods can help prevent muscle loss, promote healing and strengthen the immune system.

2. Consume high-calorie foods
TB patients often require extra calories to help aid recovery. Consuming high-calorie foods can provide the necessary energy. Some high-calorie foods that can be included in the Tuberculosis diet are avocados, cheese, nuts, peanut butter, whole milk, yoghurt, dried fruits, dark chocolate and granola bars. It's important to consume these foods in moderation and not rely on them exclusively for calorie intake.

3. Consume micronutrients
Micronutrients are essential nutrients that are required in small amounts for overall health and well-being. These include vitamins and minerals, which play a crucial role in maintaining the immune system, aiding recovery and preventing further complications. Consuming foods rich in micronutrients like dark green leafy vegetables, berries, citrus fruits, nuts and seeds can help ensure that the body is getting the necessary nutrients to function properly.
