For example, people may wish to avoid:

sulfites
salicylates
allergens, which can vary among individuals
fast foods, which tend to be highly processed

Preventing the symptoms
Some tips for preventing the symptoms of asthma include:

following a treatment plan, keeping appointments, and using all medications as the doctor advises
keeping a log of how and when symptoms appear to help identify them
taking steps to identify and avoid foods, environments, and activities that trigger symptoms
maintaining a moderate weight
avoiding or quitting smoking

Foods to Take

A diet rich in fruits and vegetables and low in processed, fatty, and fried foods can help a person manage their asthma symptoms.

Keeping track of triggers and symptoms and working with a doctor can help people with asthma control their condition more effectively.
